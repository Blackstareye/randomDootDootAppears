# Doot Doot Random Auto Player

This "project" is intended as a funny random little spook.
Within a defined random interval, the video will start and you will get spooked. It uses Greenscreen, so you can include it, whereever you want.

For example: You can include it into your OBS using "Browser Source".

## Configurations

You can set the "random interval" with the variables displayed in the picture:
